                        On the right is the American orbital infrared space telescope (James Webb Space Telescope, JWST).
                         It is intended for a wide range of observations in astronomy and cosmology, in particular, the observation of the most distant objects and events in the universe, such as the formation of the first galaxies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The development and management of the telescope is carried out through the international cooperation of 17 countries,
                        led by NASA, with significant input from the European and Canadian space agencies.
                        This telescope is the successor to Hubble as NASA's flagship astrophysics mission. At launch
                        the webb telescope was the largest, most expensive and most sensitive optical and infrared space telescope in human history.

                    &nbspIn September 1989, the Space Telescope Science Institute (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stsci.edu/" class="p_a">STScI</a>) and NASA co-hosted the Next Generation Space Telescope Workshop at STScI, bringing together more than 130 astronomers and engineers.
                     The group proposed that NASA investigate the feasibility of a 10-meter, passively cooled, near-infrared telescope in a high-Earth orbit or a 16-meter telescope based on the Moon to study galaxies at high redshift.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbspIn 1996, an 18-member committee led by astronomer Alan Dressler formally recommended that NASA develop a space telescope that would view the heavens in infrared light—the wavelength band that enables astronomers to see 
                    through dust and gas clouds and extends humanity’s vision farther out into space and back in time. It would have a mirror with a diameter of more than four meters, and operate in an orbit well beyond Earth’s moon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbspThree teams made up of scientists and engineers from the private and public sectors met to determine whether NASA could realize the committee’s vision. All three came to the conclusion that the proposed telescope would work.
                     NASA agreed in 1997 to fund additional studies to refine the technical and financial requirements for building the telescope. By 2002, the agency had selected the teams to build the instruments and the group of astronomers who would provide construction guidance. 
                     Also in 2002, the telescope was formally named the James Webb Space Telescope, after the NASA administrator who led the development of the Apollo program.

                        The James Webb Space Telescope was launched on an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arianespace.com/vehicle/ariane-5/" class="p_a">Ariane 5</a> rocket. The launch vehicle and launch site are part of the European Space Agency's contribution to the mission.
                        The Ariane 5 is one of the world's most reliable launch vehicles and was chosen for a combination of reliability (it was the only launch vehicle that met NASA's requirements for launching a mission like Webb) and for the value it brings via international partnership.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Webb was launched from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arianespace.com/?popup=ela-3-launch-zone" class="p_a">Arianespace ELA-3</a>  at Europe's Spaceport located near Kourou, French Guiana. It is beneficial for launch sites to be located near the equator - the spin of the Earth can help give an additional push.
                        The surface of the Earth at the equator is moving at 1670 km/hr.

                    <p>
                        The Launch Segment has 3 primary components:<br><br>
                        1. Launch Vehicle: an Ariane 5 with the cryogenic upper stage. Provided in the single launch configuration, with a long payload fairing providing a maximum 4.57 meter static diameter and useable length of 16.19 meters.<br><br>
                        2. Payload Adapter, comprising the Cone 3936 plus ACU 2624 lower cylinder and clamp-band, which provides the separating mechanical and electrical interface between the Webb Observatory and the Launch Vehicle.<br><br>
                        3. Launch campaign preparation and launch campaign. The launch campaign preparation and launch campaign is the mutual responsibility of NASA, ESA, Northrop Grumman and ArianeSpace.

                        When astronomers use a telescope to look further away, they are also looking back in time. The reason is simple: light needs time to travel through space. Even the light from the Moon is 1.3 seconds old when we see it on Earth.
                        The most distant galaxies the Hubble Space Telescope has viewed are more than 13 billion light-years away. That means the light Hubble captured left those galaxies over 13 billion years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the universe expands, light gets stretched into longer and longer wavelengths, beyond the visible portion of the spectrum, into the infrared. By the time visible light from extremely distant galaxies reaches us, it appears as infrared light.
                        Hubble can detect some infrared light—the wavelengths closest to the red end of the visible spectrum. The James Webb Space Telescope observes <a target="_blank" href="https://webbtelescope.org/webb-science/the-observatory/infrared-astronomy" class="p_a">infrared wavelengths</a> exclusively, seeing deeper into that portion of the spectrum than Hubble.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where Hubble sees young galaxies, Webb can show us newborns. Webb is engineered to observe the earliest stages of galaxy formation and astronomers are hopeful it will allow them to study the formation of the very first galaxies. 
                        Webb could show how small galaxies in the early universe merged to form larger galaxies. Finally, where Hubble only sees the brightest outliers from this ancient epoch, Webb is capable of revealing much more of the general population of stars and galaxies during that period. This expanded sample of early galaxies will give astronomers a better idea of how galaxies looked as they first came into being and help them map the universe’s overall structure.
